Mergify commands are powerful, user-friendly directives that you can invoke
directly from your repository's comments. Designed to streamline the
interaction with the Mergify bot, these commands empower users to execute
specific actions on pull requests without leaving the GitHub interface. Whether
you wish to rebase a branch, refresh checks, or perform any other
Mergify-supported action, a simple command can save you time and clicks.

## Getting Started with Commands

Using Mergify commands is straightforward and intuitive. These commands are
designed to be invoked directly within the comments section of your pull
requests, ensuring seamless integration with your regular GitHub workflow.
Here's a step-by-step guide to getting started:

1. **Navigate to Your Pull Request**: Head over to the pull request where you
   want to execute a Mergify action.

2. **Enter Command in the Comment Section**: In the comment box, type the
   Mergify command you wish to use. All Mergify commands are prefixed with
   `@Mergifyio` to ensure they're correctly identified and executed by the bot.
   For instance, to rebase your pull request, you'd type `@Mergifyio rebase`.

3. **Submit the Comment**: Click on the "Comment" button to post your command.
   Mergify will immediately detect the command and begin processing your
   request. Mergify will acknowledge the comment with a 👍 reaction and you'll
   see a response from the Mergify bot confirming the action or providing
   feedback in case of errors.

4. **Check Mergify's Feedback**: Once the action is complete, Mergify will
   typically leave a comment or update the pull request's status to let you
   know the outcome. This feedback can be especially useful to understand any
   issues or conflicts that might arise from the command.

5. **Advanced Commands**: Some commands may accept additional parameters or
   have specific nuances. Always refer back to this documentation to understand
   the complete syntax and behavior.

Remember, while Mergify commands are powerful and offer great convenience,
always ensure you understand the impact of a command, especially in a
collaborative environment. Misused commands can potentially disrupt the
workflow of other contributors.
