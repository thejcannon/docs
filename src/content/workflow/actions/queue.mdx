title: Queue
description: Put your pull request into the merge queue.
---

import ActionOptionsTable from '../../../components/ActionOptionsTable';

The `queue` action allows you to put a pull request into a [merge
queue](/merge-queue/intro). By placing pull requests in a queue, you can make
sure they are up-to-date and control their processing based on their priority.

Each queue can also have its own configuration for [speculative
checks](/merge-queue/speculative-checks), [batches](/merge-queue/batches), etc.

## Parameters

<ActionOptionsTable action="queue" />

## Examples

### Simple Queue

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: put PRs in queue
    conditions:
      - base=main
    actions:
      queue:
```

In this example, any pull request that is based on the main branch will be
placed in the production queue. The pull request still needs to match the
`queue_conditions` defined in the queue to enter the queue.

### Choosing the Merge Method

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: put PRs in queue (rebase)
    conditions:
      - base=main
      - label=rebase
    actions:
      queue:
        merge_method: rebase

  - name: put PRs in queue (merge)
    conditions:
      - base=main
      - label!=rebase
    actions:
      queue:
        merge_method: merge
```

In this example, any pull request that has the label `rebase` will enter the
queue with a `merge_method` set to `rebase`, ensuring it's merged via rebase.
Whereas all the other pull requests will be merged using the `merge` method.
