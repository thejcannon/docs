Effectively managing when pull requests are merged is crucial for maintaining a
smooth workflow. Mergify offers various features to schedule merges, providing
flexibility and control over your project’s integration process. This document
outlines how you can schedule your merges using different Mergify features,
including the `schedule` condition, `current-datetime` condition, `Merge-After`
feature, and `Depends-On` feature.

## Scheduling Merges During Work Hours

The `schedule` condition allows you to define specific times during the week
when merges should occur. This is particularly useful for avoiding merges
during off-hours or weekends.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: merge during work hours
    conditions:
      - schedule = Mon-Fri 09:00-17:00[Europe/Paris]
    actions:
      merge:
```
In this example, pull requests will only be merged on weekdays between 09:00
and 17:00 Paris time.

## Avoid Merges on Specific Dates

The `current-datetime` condition can be used to include or exclude specific
dates or times in your merge automation. It supports being compared to a
[timestamp](/configuration/data-types/#timestamp) or a [timestamp
interval](/configuration/data-types/#timestamp-interval).

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: avoid merges on specific dates
    conditions:
      - current-datetime != XXXX-01-01T00:00/XXXX-01-01T23:59[Europe/Paris]
    actions:
      merge:
```

This rule prevents merges from occurring on January 1st.

## Delay Merge Until a Future Date

You can use the `Merge-After` pull request header to merge a pull request after
a certain date.

Mergify automatically injects the `current-datetime >= ` condition in any rules
that contain the `merge` or `queue` action.

## Using `Depends-On` to Manage Merge Dependencies

`Depends-On` ensures a pull request is only merged after another specified pull
request has been successfully merged. This is useful for managing dependencies
between pull requests.

<Screenshot src={dependsOnBody} />

Mergify automatically injects the `depends-on` condition in any rules
that contain the `merge` or `queue` action.

<Screenshot src={dependsOnSummary} />

This rule ensures that the pull request will only be merged after PR #973 is
merged.

By using these scheduling features, you can efficiently manage your project's
merge workflow, ensuring that merges happen at the most appropriate times and
in the correct order. This not only streamlines your development process but
also helps in maintaining stability and continuity in your project.
