TeamCity is a popular Continuous Integration (CI) tool used for automating
tasks such as building, testing, and deploying software. On the other hand,
Mergify is a powerful tool that helps automate GitHub workflows. By integrating
the two, you can create a well-oiled CI/CD pipeline that will increase your
productivity and efficiency.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that you have:

- A GitHub account;

- A repository for which you have admin permissions with [Mergify
  installed](/getting-started);

- A TeamCity account.

## Using TeamCity Status Checks in Mergify Configuration

Once TeamCity reports status checks to GitHub, they can be used as conditions in
your Mergify rules. Here's a simple example:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Automatically merge when TeamCity build succeeds
    conditions:
      - check-success=TeamCity  # Change this to match your TeamCity check name
      - "#approved-reviews-by>=1"
    actions:
      merge:
        method: merge
```

In this example, Mergify will automatically merge pull requests that have at
least one approved review and a successful TeamCity build.

<Info>
  The `check-success` check name should match the name of the TeamCity check
  reporting to GitHub.
</Info>

## Further Configuration

The possibilities of integrating TeamCity with Mergify are extensive. For
instance, you could use Mergify to:

import CIFurther from './ci-further.mdx'

<CIFurther />
