import ActionOptionsTable from '../../components/ActionOptionsTable'

The `close` action allows Mergify to automatically close pull requests when
the specified conditions are met. This can be particularly useful when you
want to ensure that certain types of pull requests are not merged.

## Parameters

<ActionOptionsTable action="close" />

## Examples

### Automatically close pull request touching a file

If you wanted to automatically close pull request that touches a certain file,
let's say `do_not_touch.txt`, you could write a rule such as:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: disallow changing a file
    conditions:
      - files=do_not_touch.txt
    actions:
      close:
        message: No PR can touch this file.
```
