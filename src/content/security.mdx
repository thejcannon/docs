## User Permissions

To perform any actions on Mergify, such as adding a pull request in a merge
queue or triggering a command, a person must have sufficient access to the
relevant account or resource. This access is controlled by permissions. A
permission is the ability to perform a specific action. A role is a set of
permissions you can assign to individuals or teams.

Mergify users inherit their roles directly from [GitHub
roles](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization).

That means that a user that has the `Read` role for a repository in GitHub will
also inherit this role in Mergify.
