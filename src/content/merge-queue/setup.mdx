Mergify's Merge Queue is a powerful feature that helps you streamline and
manage your pull request (PR) merging process more efficiently.

The Merge Queue works by ensuring each PR meets all defined conditions before
it's merged. It checks for PR status, branch conditions, approval reviews, and
other set criteria, ensuring that your main branch is always stable and free of
bugs that might occur due to unreviewed code. Furthermore, by managing PRs
queue, Mergify eliminates the need for manual tracking and merging, freeing up
your team to focus on what's essential — building quality software.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting up your first
Merge Queue, explain how to add PRs to it, and show you how to configure the
conditions that the PRs must meet before being merged. Whether you're new to
Mergify or looking to make your process more efficient, this guide will give
you the knowledge you need to leverage the power of Merge Queue.

## Understanding the Default Merge Queue

Mergify provides a default merge queue named `default` for every repository as
soon as you set up Mergify. This queue works out-of-the-box and uses your
repository's [branch protection
settings](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)
defined in GitHub.

For instance, if you have branch protection rules that require passing CI
checks before merging, the `default` merge queue respects these rules. It means
Mergify will only merge pull requests that pass these checks and are in the
`default` queue.

Understanding this default queue is essential as it forms the basis of how
Mergify handles your pull requests, ensuring a streamlined and orderly merge
process.

For more details about merge queues and their functions, you can refer to our
[merge queue introduction](intro).

## Configuring the Merge Queue Rules

To have a more refined control over the PRs entering the merge queue and when
they get merged, you can set up `queue_rules` in your Mergify configuration
file. These two constructs allow you to define custom conditions that should be
met before a PR is added to the queue (`queue_conditions`) and when it can be
merged (`merge_conditions`).

Here is an example of how you can use `queue_rules`:

```yaml
queue_rules:
  - name: default
    queue_conditions:
      - check-success = mycijob
      - "#approved-reviews-by >= 1"
```

In this example, a PR can enter the `default` queue when the CI named `mycijob`
has passed, and if the pull request has been approved by at least one
contributor. If that's the not the case, the PR won't get queued.

The default for Mergify is to allow any PR to be queued.

The `merge_conditions` defines the condition required to get a PR merged once
it has entered the queue. Mergify injects all [branch protection
settings](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)
defined by GitHub, so there's no need to repeat them. You can however, add more
if you want, or only rely on Mergify for setting up those conditions:

```yaml
queue_rules:
  - name: default
    queue_conditions:
      - check-success = mycijob
      - "#approved-reviews-by >= 1"
    merge_rules:
      - check-success = mycijob-extra
```

If a PR stops matching its `queue_conditions`, it will be removed from the
queue. That means there is no need to repeat the `queue_conditions` in the
`merge_conditions` as they are implicit.

## Adding a Pull Request to the Merge Queue

{/* FIXME: link to command */}

Once you have your merge queue rules set up, you can manually add a PR to the
merge queue. To do this, use the `queue` command. This will add your PR to the
specified merge queue, or to the merge queue matching the right
`queue_conditions`.

Remember, the PR will only be merged once the conditions defined in the
`merge_conditions` field are met.

If you prefer, you can ask Mergify to automatically queue pull requests that
are ready using workflow automation.

{/* FIXME: add link to the queue command and how to do this. */}

## Monitoring Your Merge Queue

After you've added Pull Requests to your merge queue, you will want to monitor
its status to understand the progression of your PRs. This can be done directly
from the Mergify dashboard. In the "Repository" section, you will see a "Merge
Queues" tab. Clicking on it will show you the current state of your merge
queue.

<Screenshot src={queueStatusScreenshot} alt="Mergify queue status" />

Here, you can view all the PRs in the queue and their current statuses. PRs
that are waiting for their `merge_conditions` to be met are marked as pending,
while those that have met all their `queue_conditions` are displayed in the
queue and will be merged when they reach the top of the queue.

Remember, the PRs in the queue are ordered based on their addition time. The PR
added first will be merged first after all its conditions are met.

{/* FIXME: explain you can change that with priorities */}

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you've just set up your first Merge Queue with Mergify! You're
now armed with a powerful tool to automate and streamline your PR merging
process, reducing the potential for conflicts and ensuring your main branch is
always in a consistent, deployable state.

However, setting up a basic merge queue is just the beginning. Mergify's
powerful and flexible configuration system enables you to tailor your merge
queues to your specific needs.

For further exploration and inspiration, here are some additional resources and
use cases that you might find useful:

{/* FIXME: add links */}

- Using priorities to order your pull requests;
- Using multiple queues;
- Speeding up your merge queue with [speculative checks](speculative-checks);
- Saving CI time with batches;
- Delaying checks at merge time;
- Splitting repositories into partitions (monorepo support).

Remember, the possibilities with merge queues are limited only by your
imagination. Happy merging!
