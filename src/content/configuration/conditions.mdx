Conditions are an essential component of Mergify rules, as they define the
criteria that must be met for a rule to be applied. By utilizing conditions,
you can create highly customizable and flexible rules tailored to your specific
workflow requirements. Conditions enable you to target pull requests based on
various factors such as their status, properties, labels, and associated
statuses or checks.

In this guide, we will explore the structure, syntax, and usage of conditions
in Mergify rules. You will learn how to craft effective conditions that help
you automate and streamline your pull request management process.

## Structure of a Condition

A condition in Mergify rules is composed of three key components: attributes,
operators, and values, along with optional modifiers. These components work
together to define the criteria that must be met for the condition to be
considered true.

The grammar for a condition is as follows:

`[ "-" ] [ "#" ] <attribute> [ <operator> <value> ]`

### Modifiers

- The optional minus (`-`) operator at the beginning of the condition negates
  the result of the condition, acting as a "not" operator.

- The optional hash (`#`) operator is used to evaluate the length of a list
  when the attribute is a list.

### Attributes

Attributes represent the properties or characteristics of a pull request that
you want to evaluate in your condition. These can include elements such as the
number of approvals, the presence of specific labels, or the status of CI
checks.

### Operators

Operators are used to compare the attribute to a specified value. Mergify
supports various comparison operators (e.g., `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`).

When the attribute is a list, comparison operators behave as if "any" is used on
the list, meaning the condition will return true if any element of the list
matches the given operator and value.

### Values

Values are the reference points used to evaluate the attribute. They can be
strings, numbers, or booleans, depending on the attribute being evaluated.

For example, consider the following condition:

`#approved-reviews-by>=2`

In this condition:

- The attribute is `approved-reviews-by`, which represents the list of approved
  reviewers for a pull request.

- The operator is `>=`, which means "greater than or equal to."

- The value is `2`, which indicates the minimum number of approved reviews
  required for the condition to be true.

- The hash (`#`) operator is used to evaluate the length of the list of
  approved reviewers.

Understanding the structure of a condition is crucial for creating effective
Mergify rules that cater to your specific needs and requirements.

## Attributes List

Attributes are properties of pull requests or events used to filter and evaluate
the conditions within rules. They can be used to create more specific and
targeted rules for your repository.

## Operators List

Operators allow you to compare attributes with specified values in order to
determine if a condition is true or false. Mergify supports several types of
operators that cater to different types of comparisons. Familiarizing yourself
with these operators is essential for crafting effective conditions in your
Mergify rules.

Here is a list of the available operators:

<Table>
  <Thead>
    <Tr>
      <Th>Operator Name</Th>
      <Th>Symbols</Th>
      <Th>Description</Th>
    </Tr>
  </Thead>

  <Tbody>
    <Tr>
      <Td>Equal</Td>

      <Td>
        `=` or `:`
      </Td>

      <Td lineHeight='7'>This operator checks for strict equality. If the target attribute
      type is a list, each element of the list is compared against the value
      and the condition is true if **any** value matches.</Td>
    </Tr>

    <Tr>
      <Td>Not Equal</Td>

      <Td>
        `!=` or `≠`
      </Td>

      <Td lineHeight='7'>This operator checks for non equality. If the target attribute type
      is a list, each element of the list is compared against the value and
      the condition is true if no value matches.</Td>
    </Tr>

    <Tr>
      <Td>Match</Td>

      <Td>
        `~=`
      </Td>

      <Td lineHeight='7'>This operator checks for [regular
      expressions](data-types#regular-expressions)
      matching. If the target attribute type is a list, each
      element of the list is matched against the value and the condition is
      true if any value matches.</Td>
    </Tr>

    <Tr>
      <Td>Greater Than or Equal</Td>

      <Td>
        `>=` or `≥`
      </Td>

      <Td lineHeight='7'>This operator checks for the value to be greater than or equal to the
      provided value. It's usually used to compare against the length of a
      list using the `#` prefix.</Td>
    </Tr>

    <Tr>
      <Td>Greater Than</Td>

      <Td>
        `>`
      </Td>

      <Td lineHeight='7'>This operator checks for the value to be greater than the provided
      value. It's usually used to compare against the length of a list using
      the `#` prefix.</Td>
    </Tr>

    <Tr>
      <Td>Lesser Than or Equal</Td>

      <Td>
        `<=` or `≤`
      </Td>

      <Td lineHeight='7'>This operator checks for the value to be lesser then or equal to the
      provided value. It's usually used to compare against the length of a
      list using the `#` prefix.</Td>
    </Tr>

    <Tr>
      <Td>Lesser Than</Td>

      <Td>
        `<`
      </Td>

      <Td lineHeight='7'>
        This operator checks for the value to be lesser than the provided value. It's
        usually used to compare against the length of a list using the `#` prefix.
      </Td>
    </Tr>
  </Tbody>
</Table>

For example, let's consider a condition that requires a pull request to have
a specific label:

`label=bugfix`

In this condition:

- The attribute is `label`, which represents the labels associated with a pull
    request.

- The operator is `=`, which means "equal to."

- The value is `bugfix`, which is the label we want the pull request to have.

### Operators on Lists

Some [attributes](conditions#attributes) have a type of `list`. Most
[operators](conditions#operators) are able to match value against lists: they
will iterate over all the values of the list and return true if **any** of the
value matches.

For example, the `label` attribute is a list of string containing the names
of the label attached to a pull request. With a pull request whose labels are
`(bug, work-in-progress)`, then:

- `label=work-in-progress` is **true** because there is a label named
  `work-in-progress`.

- `label=enhancement` is **false** because there is no label named
  `enhancement`.

- `label!=work-in-progress` is **false** because there is a label named
  `work-in-progress`.

- `label~=^work` is **true** because there is a label matching the regular
  expression `^work`.

- `-label~=^work` is **false** because there is a label matching the regular
   expression `^work` but the condition is reversed with the `-` prefix.

The same applies for the `files` attribute — which contains the list of
modified files:

- `files=README` is **true** if the file `README` is modified in the pull
  request.

- `files!=README` is **true** if the file `README` is not modified in the pull
  request.

- `files~=^src/` is **true** if any files in the `src` directory is modified in
  the pull request.

- `-files~=^src/` is **true** if none of the files that are modified are in the
  `src` directory.

- `files~=^(README.md|CONTRIBUTING.md)$` is **true** if the file `README.md`
  **or** `CONTRIBUTING.md` is modified in the pull requests.

### Examples with Operators

#### Apply the rule only to pull requests with a specific milestone

In this example, we use the `=` operator to match a specific milestone for the
pull request:

```yaml
- name: Rule for milestone "v1.0"
  conditions:
    - milestone="v1.0"
  actions:
    # Your actions here
```

{/* lint ignore */}

#### Apply the rule only when the number of changes is less than or equal to a certain threshold

In this example, we use the `<= operator` to check if the number of files
modified in the pull request is less than or equal to 50:

```yaml
- name: Rule for small changes
  conditions:
    - "#files<=50"
  actions:
    # Your actions here
```
{/* lint ignore */}

#### Apply the rule only when the pull request is labeled with at least one of the specified labels

In this example, we use the `!=` operator to check if the pull request does not
have the specified labels:

```yaml
- name: Rule when not a bug
  conditions:
    - label!=bug
  actions:
    # Your actions here
```

## Combining Conditions Using Logical Operators

Mergify allows you to combine multiple conditions using logical operators,
making it possible to create more intricate rules that cater to your specific
workflow requirements. You can use the `and` and `or` logical operators to join
conditions together.

### The `and` Operator

The `and` operator is used to join conditions such that all conditions must be
true for the overall condition to be true. In Mergify rules, the `and` operator
is represented by placing conditions on separate lines within the same rule.

Alternatively, you can use the `and` keyword to explicitly group conditions
together.

Example:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Merge when all conditions are met
    conditions:
      - and:
        - "#approved-reviews-by>=2"
        - "status-success=test job"
    actions:
      merge:
        method: merge
```

In this example, the pull request will only be merged if it has at least 2
approved reviews and the `test job` check passes.

### The `or` Operator

The `or` operator is used to join conditions such that if any one of the
conditions is true, the overall condition is considered true. In Mergify rules,
the `or` operator is represented by using the `or` keyword and specifying
conditions as a list.

Example:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Merge when either condition is met
    conditions:
      - or:
        - "#approved-reviews-by>=2"
        - "status-success=test job"
    actions:
      merge:
        method: merge
```

In this example, the pull request will be merged if it has at least 2 approved
reviews or if the `test job` check passes.

Combining conditions using logical operators can help you create more
sophisticated rules tailored to your repository's workflow and requirements.

## Testing and Debugging Conditions

When crafting conditions for your Mergify rules, it's essential to test and
debug them to ensure they are working as intended. This section will guide you
through the process of testing and debugging conditions in your Mergify
configuration.

### Use the Mergify Configuration Editor

The Mergify configuration editor is a useful tool to help you test your
conditions and rules on existing pull requests without actually triggering the
actions defined in your rules. To access the configuration editor, follow these
steps:

1. Navigate to your [Mergify dashboard](https://dashboard.mergify.com).
2. Select the repository you want to test.
3. Click on the "Config Editor" tab.

<Screenshot src={configEditorScreenshot} alt="Mergify Configuration Editor" />

In the configuration editor, you can enter your conditions and see how they
would be evaluated on your pull requests. You can also test your entire Mergify
configuration by copying and pasting it into the configuration editor.

### Analyze the Mergify Checks

Once you have created and committed your Mergify configuration file, Mergify
will evaluate the conditions in your rules for each pull request. To debug your
conditions and understand why a rule may not be working as expected, you can
analyze the Mergify Checks on a pull request:

1. Navigate to the "Checks" tab of the pull request.
2. Look for the "Mergify" check in the list of checks.
3. Click on "Summary" to view the detailed Mergify report.

In the Mergify report, you can see which rules were evaluated and whether the
conditions were met or not. This can help you identify any issues in your
conditions and make adjustments as necessary.
