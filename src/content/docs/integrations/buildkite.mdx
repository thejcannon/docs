[Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) is a CI/CD tool providing scalable
orchestration system, dynamic pipelines, customizable runners, and a great
local development experience. Mergify can interact with Buildkite by evaluating
[the status
checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks)
reported by Buildkite to GitHub. This enables powerful automation workflows
that react to the results of your Buildkite jobs.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use Mergify with Buildkite, ensure the following:

1. Buildkite is properly set up and is building your projects. See the
   [Buildkite
   Documentation](https://buildkite.com/docs/tutorials/getting-started) for
   help with setting up Buildkite.

2. Buildkite is [configured to report build statuses to
   GitHub](https://buildkite.com/docs/integrations/github#connecting-buildkite-and-github).

3. The [Mergify GitHub App](/getting-started) is installed in your repository.

## Using Buildkite Status Checks in Mergify Configuration

Once Buildkite reports status checks to GitHub, they can be used as conditions
in your Mergify rules.

Here's a simple example:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Automatically merge when Buildkite build succeeds
    conditions:
      - check-success=buildkite/github-test  # Change this to match your Buildkite check name
      - "#approved-reviews-by>=1"
    actions:
      merge:
        method: merge
```

In this example, Mergify will automatically merge pull requests that have at
least one approved review and a successful Buildkite build.

## Further Configuration

The possibilities of integrating Buildkite with Mergify are extensive.
For instance, you could use Mergify to:

import CIFurther from './_ci-further.mdx'

<CIFurther />
